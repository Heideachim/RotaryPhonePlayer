# Dial Phone with MP3 #
Use an old-fashioned phone with a rotary dial to play MP3 audio files. For every number dialled, an audio file is played back using the regular earphone capsule of the receiver.
## What it does ##
An Arduino Nano decodes the dialing impulses of the phone. Then, it sends commands via a serial interface to an MP3 player, which does the actual playing. MP3s are stored on a micro SD card.
